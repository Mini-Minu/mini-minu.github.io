    <h1>Eight fast food restaurants to avoid</h1>

<h3>1. McDonald's</h3>
    <img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nintchdbpict000177708607.jpg">
<p>This one tops the list. McDonald's is so extemely unhealthy, although it's extremely hard to stay away from.
    Many people believe that it doesn't hurt much to eat McDonald's, but there is evidence that it can significantly increase you risk of Type 2 Diabetes. Also, it almost isn't even real food. A McBurger from 1999 sits today, without any trace of aging or mold.
    You'll be doing your body a favor by cutting out this restaurant from your diet.</p>
